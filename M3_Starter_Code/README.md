# customer_banking

In this customer_banking challennge we will be importing files to a "main" file to which we will be prompting the user with calculations which solve for variables such as interest and updated balances.

The applications of this exercise are with a Savings Account, as well as a CD account. There, we take the initial values implemented by the customer, and calculate the yield on each respective account.
